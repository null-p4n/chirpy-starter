Protect Your Privacy: Beware of Malware That Steals Chrome Cookies and Passwords.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of days ago I encountered what seems an ad for "ChatGPT-4" at first sight but didn't take long to observe the red flag,
a .zip file hosted on a platform called Trello, a "tool that organizes your projects into boards" as they say on their website.

We can say our [APT](Advanced persistent threat) is pretty organized but leaving jokes aside, a [cookie stealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking) is pretty serious since a few days ago multiple malware alike we're deployed attacking youtubers like LinusTechTips or gaming studios like  [Electronic Arts. ](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/08/18/cookie-stealing-the-new-perimeter-bypass/)

After a brief look I took a sample of it in an enclosed environment and I started fingerprinting it using virus total, as I anticipated I encounterd a stealth virus "typically, a stealth virus can hide in the legitimate files, partitions or boot sectors of a computing device without alerting the antivirus software or notifying the user of its presence. Once injected into a computer, the virus enables the attackers to operate and gain control over parts of the system or the entire system." with a dimension of 800mb+ virus total couldn't scan it
