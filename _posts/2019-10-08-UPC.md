I’ve recently tested a UPC old router, to be specific a Ubee EVW3226 cable modem. 
This specific model is using WPS, an outdated security protocol for authentication 
and sadly can be easily bypassed by any script kiddie using tools as Wifite or a simple 
Android app. Not only is vulnerabile to this attack but also can be DOS-ed abusing port 80. 
Nmap shows that is vulnerabile to Slowloris or CVE-2007-6750 but I didn’t test yet. 
But I didn’t finish yet, routers use pathetic login credentials like admin/admin making 
for an attackers a piece of cake to change your “password” and SSID or changing DNS server 
and stealing your online banking account. If your router is vulnerabile to the same type of 
attack change your WiFi password and router login page password immediately!

Firstly, it is essential to change the default credentials of your router. Many routers come with default usernames and passwords, which are easily accessible and well-known to potential attackers. Changing the default credentials to a strong and unique username and password can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

Secondly, you can disable WPS if you do not need it. WPS is a feature that allows for easy and quick setup of wireless networks, but it is also a security vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers. By disabling WPS, you can prevent attackers from using tools like router keygen to break into your router.

Lastly, it is essential to keep your router firmware up-to-date. Router manufacturers often release firmware updates that address security vulnerabilities and improve overall performance. By regularly updating your router firmware, you can ensure that your router is protected against known security threats.

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to use tools like router keygen to break into routers, it is important to respect others' privacy and security. Instead, focus on securing your own router by changing default credentials, disabling unnecessary features, and keeping firmware up-to-date. This way, you can help ensure that your network is secure and protected against potential attacks.
